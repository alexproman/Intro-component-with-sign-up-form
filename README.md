## Overview

This project showcases an interactive and responsive signup form where users can enter their details to register.
 The form validates inputs such as email, password, and confirm password fields to ensure correct data entry before submission.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**:
   Used for structuring the page with semantic tags like header, main, section, form, etc.
- **CSS3**
   Applied for styling, with features such as Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**
   Used to handle form validation and provide user feedback for incorrect input.



## Features:

Semantic HTML: Utilized semantic HTML5 elements to structure the page meaningfully and improve accessibility.
CSS Styling: Applied pure CSS for styling, focusing on a clean and modern design with mobile responsiveness.
JavaScript Form Validation: Added JavaScript for form validation to check user input before submission, including:
Email format validation.
Password strength and confirmation validation.
Error messages for incorrect inputs.

## What I Learned
- HTML Semantics:
  Strengthened my understanding of semantic HTML by using proper tags like <section>, <form>, and <label>.This improves accessibility and SEO.

- CSS Flexbox and Media Queries:
  Enhanced my skills in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox and media queries to ensure the form looks great on all screen sizes.

- JavaScript Validation: Improved my JavaScript skills by adding custom validation to the form. 
  I learned how to dynamically display error messages and prevent form submission if the input is incorrect.

- User Experience:
  Focused on user feedback, ensuring that when errors occur, the form clearly communicates the problem with redirections to help users fix issues efficiently.

## Design

### Why Mobile First?
- Enhances performance on mobile devices.
